# Sentinels
Our full bot is very compact. We made our circuit part very compact. it looks very nice.
We made a app for controlling bot using MIT APP INVENTOR
We can control our bot using voice. This is the special feature of our bot.
Some voice command- go forward, go back, turn left, turn right

Our esp32 got burnt so we used esp8266.
